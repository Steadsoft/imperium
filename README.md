## The home of the Imperium programming language

Imperium is a programming language that emphasizes readability, extensibility, internationalization and pragmatism. The name "Imperium" is a Latin term meaning "control" in English. The language is designed to provide the developer with control, it is well suited for use on Microcontrollers for example by virtue of its range of memory defining features, padding and alignment as well as its support for "bit" data types enabling fine grained control over bit level memory layouts.

The language has no "reserved words" which means it doesn't care if an identifier happens to also be the same as a language keyword, adding new keywords is easy because backward compatibility is always ensured. The language also supports international use, it can be used with English, French, Dutch and other keyword sets and additional language keyword sets can be easily added.
